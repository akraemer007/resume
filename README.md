# Resume

My MS-word template served me well, but after 3 jobs and endless tweaks it became a formatting nightmare. I pivoted from analyst to Data Scientist / Software engineer, I couldn't bring myself to try to salvage my old resume -- especially given my new credentials. Furthermore, I'm always interested in learning another old school linux tool, so I figured my resume would be a great way to learn laTex. laTex apeals to me as it seems more stable than MS-word -- espeically given that I primarilly use a Mac now.

I stole my original template from [here](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume).
